<br><b>Course Description:</b>
</td>
<td align="justify">
<br>
The objective of this course is to present an overview of the principles and practices of AI and to address complex real-world problems. Through introduction of AI tools and techniques, the course helps students develop a basic understanding of problem solving, search, theorem proving, knowledge representation, reasoning and planning methods of AI; and develop practical applications in vision, language, and so on. Topics include foundations (search, knowledge representation, machine learning and natural language understanding) and applications (data mining, decision support systems, adaptive web sites, web log analysis).

<b>Collaboration among Students:</b>
</td>
<td align="justify">
We encourage collaboration between students and studying materials in groups when the purpose of this is to facilitate learning, not to circumvent problems. It is allowed to seek help from other students in understanding the material needed to solve a particular problem. However, students must submit individual material and solutions, unless otherwise specified. Students should declare any collaboration on the first page of homework assignments (or equivalently on exercises). If the instructors believe the collaboration is improper, your grade may be affected. <br><br>

We encourage you to use ChatGPT to solve the homework assignment problems (because likely in the future everyone will use it for coding). However, you will need to declare using ChatGPT/LLMs in the homework write-up, as well as the prompts you use
